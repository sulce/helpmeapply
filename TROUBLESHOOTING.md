# Resume Builder Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸš¨ **If /resume-builder keeps loading:**

### **Quick Fixes:**

1. **Wait 10 seconds** - The page has a timeout that will automatically load after 10 seconds
2. **Click "Continue Anyway"** - If you see the loading screen, there's a button to proceed
3. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes a simple refresh resolves loading issues
4. **Check browser console** - Press F12 and look for any error messages

### **What the fixes do:**

- âœ… **Better error handling** - Won't get stuck on API failures
- âœ… **Timeout protection** - Automatically proceeds after 10 seconds
- âœ… **Fallback data** - Starts with empty resume if profile load fails
- âœ… **Manual override** - "Continue Anyway" button to force load

### **Expected behavior now:**
1. **Page loads** within a few seconds
2. **If it takes too long** - you'll see a "Continue Anyway" button
3. **Either way** - you'll get to the resume builder interface
4. **Start fresh** - Begin filling out your resume sections

## ðŸŽ¯ **Once it loads, you can:**

- âœ… Fill out contact information
- âœ… Add work experience
- âœ… List your skills and education  
- âœ… Generate professional PDF resumes
- âœ… Apply to jobs with customized resumes

## ðŸ”§ **If you still have issues:**

1. **Clear browser cache** and try again
2. **Try incognito/private mode**
3. **Check if you're signed in** - go to `/auth/signin` if needed
4. **Use a different browser** to test

The resume builder is now much more robust and should work even if some backend services are having issues.
